# design-system-poc

## Introduction
This project is a **proof of concept** for a flexible, scalable design system framework. It demonstrates a **component architecture** that focuses on delivering an exceptional **developer experience**. The current stage of development showcases early versions of **layout components** and the **component property (props) processing logic**. You can explore examples of usage and see the components in action through **Storybook**.

The project is currently in an **early prototype phase**, and further work will be done in a new project which I will post a link to when we begin.

## Current Features
- **Component Architecture**: A React-based component library showcasing early-stage layout components and props processing.
- **Storybook Integration**: Explore and test the available components interactively through Storybook.

## Usage

You can run **Storybook** to see demos and interact with the design system components:

```bash
yarn
yarn storybook
```

## Future Plans
Although development is currently on hold, future plans include:
- **Base Design System**: Implement a comprehensive design token system for colors, spacing, typography, and more.
- **Governance Ruleset**: Define and enforce a structured approach to managing consistent design decisions, including controlled deviations for special elements.
- **Customizable Scaling**: Add the ability to customize scaling values dynamically, ensuring flexibility for specific project needs.
- **Complete Component Library**: Build a fully customizable React component library generated directly into projects, allowing users full control over component selection and styling.
- **React Native Support**: Extend the design system framework to support React Native, allowing for seamless cross-platform development.
